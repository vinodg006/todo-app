# Todos using ReactJS with React Router

3 Views
All - Path: /

Active - Path: /active

Completed - Path: /completed



Implemented using React Router. Use the filters at the bottom to determine which path the user is 'navigated' to. All todos will be visible when a user navigates to / . Active will navigate to /active and Completed will navigate to /completed . 

The text that indicates the number of items left (located in the footer) which will automatically change whenever a todo is marked completed or an active todo is deleted.
